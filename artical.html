            <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR ( 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[2] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[3][4][5] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
            <p>Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a sister, Asim Zohra (d. 1997), followed by three elder brothers: Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar (5 November 1916 – 7 March 2021),[99][100] Mustafa Kalam (d. 1999) and Kasim Mohammed (d. 1995).[101] He was extremely close to his elder siblings and their extended families throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of money to his older relations, himself remaining a lifelong bachelor.</p>
              <h3> <b> <u>EDUCATION</u></b></h3>
              <div>
            <span class="s1"><img class="ed" src="apjed.jpeg" width="600" alt="">
             <img class="ed" src="apj1.jpeg" width="600" alt=""></span> 
              <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[10] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi</p>
              <p>In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics.[22] After completing his education at Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend the St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli from where he graduated in Physics in 1954</p>
              <p>Kalam moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.[14] While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline."[24] He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF</p>
              <h3> <b><u>Career as a scientist</u></b></h3>
              <div>
              <span class="s1"><img class="helo" src="apj.sci1.jpeg" alt=""><br>
              <img class="dr" src="aplsci.jpeg" alt=""></span>
               </div>
               <p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career
                 by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[27] Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[14] He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).
                 In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.
                  In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers</p>
               <p>In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.[12][29] Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.</p>
               <p>Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project 
                Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase.[12][33] Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country's best known nuclear scientist.[34] However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report.
                 Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.</p>


                <h3> <b><u>Post-presidency </b></u></h3>

               <span class="s1"><img class="br" src="apj pot.jpeg" width="" alt="" >
               <img class="ed" src="apjpot1.jpg" width="" alt=""></span>
               <p>Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007</p>
                <p>On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,[41][42] and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy.[43][44] After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not 
                    to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear.</p>

               <p>After leaving office, Kalam became a visiting professor at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the Indian Institute of Management Indore; an honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore;[81] chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram;
                 professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna University; and an adjunct at many other academic and research institutions across India. He taught information technology at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, and technology at Banaras Hindu University and Anna University.In 2011, Kalam was criticised by civil groups over 
                 his stand on the Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant; he supported the establishment of the nuclear power plant and was accused of not speaking with the local people.[83] The protesters were hostile to his visit as they saw him as a pro-nuclear scientist and were unimpressed by the assurances he provided regarding the safety features of the plant.[84]
                In May 2012, Kalam launched a programme for the youth of India called the What Can I Give Movement, with a central theme of defeating corruption.</p>

              <div>
                <p>The Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Memorial[95] was built in memory of Kalam by the DRDO in Pei Karumbu, in the island town of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. It was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July 2017.[96][97] On display are the replicas of rockets and missiles which Kalam had worked with. Acrylic paintings about his life are also displayed 
                    along with hundreds of portraits depicting the life of the mass leader. There is a statue of Kalam in the entrance showing him playing the Veena. There are two other smaller statues of the leader in sitting and standing posture.</p>
